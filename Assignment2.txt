1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
-> True and False are the two values of boolean data type. They are case sensitive.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
-> (i) and => this operator takes two inputs and returns true only if both the inputs satisfy the given condition
   (ii) or => this operator takes two inputs and returns true if either of the inputs satisfy the given condition
   (iii) not => this operator takes one input and returns the opposite of the given input. 

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
->            AND                     OR                   NOT
        A  B   A and B            A   B    A or B         A     ~A
	0  0	0                 0   0      0            0	1
	0  1    0                 0   1      1            1	0
	1  0 	0                 1   0      1
	1  1 	1                 1   1      1

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                        # False
not (5 > 4)                                 # False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                         # True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                   # False
(True and True) and (True == False)         # False
(not False) or (not True)                   # True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
The 6 comparison operators in python are >,<,>=,<=,==,!=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
-> assignment operator is denoted by = and to check the equality == operator is used.
If I want to see if 5 is equal to 6, then I would use 5 == 6
If I want to assign 5 to a, then I would use a = 5

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
	print('eggs')
	if spam > 5:
		print('bacon')
else:
	print('ham')
	print('spam')
	print('spam')
	
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input())
if spam == 1:
	print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
	print("Howdy")
else:
	print("Greetings")
	
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
-> Ctrl + c

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
-> Break is used to terminate the loop when a condition is met, while continue is used to skip one iteration of the loop

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
-> range(10) will print numbers from 0 to 9 even though we did not give lower bound
-> range(0,10) will print 0 to 9 (here we have given the lower bound)
-> range(0,10,1) will print 0 to 9 with a difference of 1

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

using for loop:
for idx in range(11):
    print(idx)
	
using while loop:
a = 10
while a >= 0:
    print(a)
    a= a -1
    

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

import bacon from spam
spam.bacon()
